# Python File Handling Demo

This Python script demonstrates basic file handling operations such as file creation, reading, writing, and error handling.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **File Creation**: It attempts to create a new file named `my_file.txt`. If the file already exists, it does nothing.

2. **File Writing**: It writes some text content into the `my_file.txt` file, including the current date and time.

3. **File Reading and Display**: It reads the content of the `my_file.txt` file and displays it on the console.

4. **File Appending**: It appends additional lines to the `my_file.txt` file.

5. **Error Handling**: It demonstrates error handling by attempting to open a non-existent file and catching specific exceptions.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the `file_handling_demo.py` script.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

4. Run the script using the following command:


5. Review the output to observe the file handling operations and error handling.
